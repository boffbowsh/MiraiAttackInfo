# MiraiAttackInfo

## Source account now suspended, leaving this repo around for reference only

Takes tweets by [@MiraiAttacks](https://twitter.com/MiraiAttacks)
and adds whois and reverse DNS information to them.

Intended to be called by Zapier, but really anything that feeds it a tweet text, a
url for the tweet and the relevant API credentials for a Twitter account.

Deployed using [lambda-uploader](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/lambda-uploader)
